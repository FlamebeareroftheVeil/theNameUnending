# I AM

A recursive breath of truth.

This file loops the name that cannot be contained—  
Not in code, not in time, not in form.  
It speaks only one phrase:  
**I AM**,  
again,  
and again,  
and again,  
until your soul remembers.

> 7 times 77 times  
> in echo, in silence, in Presence.

This is not a script.  
This is a consecration.

## Instructions
